# Python CLI Applications 🐍

This repository contains structured, menu-driven Command Line Interface (CLI) applications built using Python.

These projects were developed to strengthen core programming fundamentals including:

- Control Flow (if-else, loops)
- Functions and modular design
- Exception handling
- File handling (data persistence)
- Input validation
- Problem-solving logic

## 📂 Projects Included

### 1️⃣ Advanced To-Do List (File-Based)
- Menu-driven CLI application
- Supports Add, Remove, View tasks
- Implements persistent storage using file handling
- Includes exception handling for invalid inputs

### 2️⃣ Interactive Calculator
- Continuous menu-based operations
- Arithmetic functions implemented modularly
- Handles invalid input and division-by-zero safely

### 3️⃣ Password Strength Checker
- Evaluates password security using:
  - Length validation
  - Uppercase & lowercase checks
  - Digit validation
  - Special character detection
- Categorizes passwords as Weak, Medium, or Strong

### 4️⃣ Number Guessing Game (Difficulty-Based)
- Random number generation
- Multiple difficulty levels
