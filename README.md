# Python CLI Applications 🐍

This repository contains structured, menu-driven Command Line Interface (CLI) applications built using Python.

These projects were developed to strengthen core programming fundamentals including:

- Control Flow (if-else, loops)
- Functions and modular design
- Exception handling
- File handling (data persistence)
- Input validation
- Problem-solving logic

---
